# Coop-game

So how is it all works anyway?

If you want to actually play in this you just need to download the packaged game from my drive and start .exe

If you want to try coop feature you need:
2) Open the game, then press ~ and type in "open Blockout_P?listen" - now you are the host
3)After that, your friend need to open the console with the same ~ key and type in "your.ip.number:7777"
